### Is Your Bank Really Digital?
We know from recent [Accenture research](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/does-digital-banking-leadership-matter) that mastering digital banking is increasingly associated with both superior operating economics and a market valuation premium. But that research begs the question how a Board, C-suite, and external stakeholders should objectively assess digital maturity. How do they know that the bank is embracing digital to the extent that it will be able to compete in an increasingly complex market where their rivals are not only other traditional banks, but also fast growing neo banks and big tech firms that see *financial services* as an important part of their broader value proposition?

Carl Jung, the father of analytical psychology, observed that, *“to ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem.”* So, we aggregated the experience of the Accenture Banking practice to come up with the following ten questions to help measure whether a bank should consider itself in the digital premier league of the industry.

## 1. Does the bank have a mobile-first distribution model?
There are still banks that think of anything other than the branch as an ‘alternative channel,’ but a true digital bank starts from the mobile experience and then considers how other channels (including branches, ATMs, call centers and relationship managers) can support a digital-first proposition. When you design for mobile first, other ways of interacting move from being costly alternatives to differentiating enhancements. So non-mobile channels should be staffed from top to bottom with people who understand and embrace the mobile-first approach, rather than resist it because they’re worried about their jobs. Also, true digital banks now typically have all channels under a single leader to ensure a focus on the overall customer experience.

## 2. Is the bank using technology to eliminate the back-office?
From risk management to customer service, the default processes should be data- and analytics-powered and use all available tools (including RPA and Artificial Intelligence) to minimize human touch-points, driving down the cost-to-serve. True digital banks want each employee to be able to service tens of thousands of retail and small business customers. Humans can in turn focus on jobs that require judgement calls that go beyond the capabilities of automated processes.


## 3. Does the bank embrace Open Banking?
Rather than treating Open Banking as an annoying compliance and regulatory issue, the best digital banks are embracing both the import and export advantages of Open Banking. On the import side, banks should be incorporating third-party offerings that are demonstrably best for customers. On the export side, core products become “platform-as-a-service” components ready to be shipped out through APIs to enhance other third-party offerings and turbo charge growth.

## 4. Is the bank willing to push the boundaries of its business model?
Is the bank actively considering income streams beyond traditional banking where the bank believes its customer relationships give it a competitive advantage? Digital innovations will increasingly compress traditional bank fee income streams like payment and overdraft charges, so banks need to be willing to use their data and their privileged position to reposition themselves in their customers’ lives to become a trusted day-to-day advisor that can improve broader financial well-being. In many cases, that will mean sacrificing short-term product revenue to secure long-term customer loyalty, and it will mean building partnerships with non-financial-services product providers.

## 5. Has the bank become a truly data-driven organization?
Not everyone who owns a car needs to drill their own oil well, so the best digital banks are mastering data supply chain and data management by balancing centralized data provisioning with decentralized insight utilization to drive increased profitability. The leading digital banks increasingly have a Chief Data Officer with a seat at the top table to ensure that data permeates every aspect of the organization. Banks have a privileged position in the economy in that they act as both the scorekeepers and facilitators for everyone else’s business — that provides them with reams of useful data, but a true digital bank knows how to use that fuel to power faster growth and higher profits.

## 6. Is the bank using public cloud as its default infrastructure?
A default public cloud architecture drives a lot of positive behaviors around modern engineering practices, technology development approaches, data management and analytics. Increasingly, the most compelling reason to be on the cloud is gaining access to the data management and analytical tools provided by public cloud providers. Even if public cloud isn’t currently the right answer for every application, the best digital banks continually ask the question, “Why not?”

## 7. Does the bank understand that true enterprise agility is a team sport?
A truly digital bank has all hands-on deck, including HR, compliance, risk, financial planning, and control systems, to support a nimble approach to the business. Those that do it right are aggressively moving budgets from run-the-business to change-the-business initiatives through a processes that focuses less on fiefdoms and more on enterprise outcomes and winning together.

## 8. Does the bank’s business strategy emphasize innovation at the core?
Some banks, unfortunately, are hoping that peripheral challenger initiatives will someday grow to a scale that the bank will be able to absorb to transform the legacy bank. However, change needs to come from the part of the bank that houses the bulk of the balance sheet and customers; if not, any technological innovations are likely to remain just gnats on the elephant from a valuation perspective. For incumbents, that means harnessing the power and strengths of the traditional banking business model to better serve all of their customers, instead of dismissing those capabilities as irrelevant and outdated.

## 9. Does the bank have a disciplined fintech engagement model?
While it is great to have innovation labs, venture capital investment stakes, and consortium memberships, the real litmus test for a bank’s engagement with the fintech community is whether that engagement promotes real change for customer-facing products. Bank that have tried to buy innovation by purchasing and integrating fintechs have often seen their impact minimized by the gravitational pull of the traditional bank business model. No bank is going to be the sole source of innovation, so how a bank engages with the broader ecosystem to filter, prioritize, and monetize the good ideas coming from other institutions is going to be key to staying at the forefront of the industry.

## 10. Does the bank have a culture and HR approach that values technology and engineering skills?
Does a tech mindset permeate every level of the organization — from the boardroom to graduate recruits — and create an environment that not only attracts top-tier talent but also allows it to thrive and develop? A diversity of skills and experience is key to designing great digital customer experiences. And building a great engineering culture doesn’t mean doing everything yourself. The best digital banks still leverage technology partners to accelerate innovation and change.

### Conclusion
For many incumbent banks, the answers to these ten questions could generate a daunting list of to dos. However, the reality is that we are entering a period of change in the banking industry where new entrants are taking customer share and where the gap between the winners and losers is widening. If an incumbent bank is going to force its way to the forefront of the industry, it’s going to need to put digital front and center.
