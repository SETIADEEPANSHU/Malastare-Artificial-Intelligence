### AI overview

Received: 05 July 2019; Accepted: 13 August 2019; Published: 17 September 2019

Discussions, articles, and reports about the AI opportunity across Fintech industries continue to proliferate amid considerable hype around the technologies, and for good reason: The aggregate potential cost savings for banks from AI applications is estimated at $447 billion by 2023, with the front and middle office accounting for $416 billion of that total, per Autonomous Next research seen by Malastare AI.

Most banks (80%) are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI, as per an OpenText survey of financial services professionals. In fact, many banks are planning to deploy solutions enabled by AI: 75% of respondents at banks with over $100 billion in assets say they're currently implementing AI strategies, compared with 46% at banks with less than $100 billion in assets, per a UBS Evidence Lab report seen by Malastare AI. Certain AI use cases have already gained prominence across banks' operations, with chatbots in the front office and anti-payments fraud in the middle office the most mature.

So, you're thinking about bringing AI technology to your financial institution - what do you need to take into consideration?

*First,* decide if you are betting for a chatbot or conversational UI in your app, or both. Regardless of the previous choice, the successful uptake of a natural language interface will largely depend on the culture of the market in which you operate.

*Second,* bot discovery could be an issue for generic brands trying to get user attention, but I don’t think discoverability will be a problem for a bank bot because, as a user, I will look for the service in the same way I follow companies' Twitter accounts for customer service purposes. It will need some solid marketing though.

*Third,* a bot might seem a good and easy way to keep in touch with your customer base, however prepare for some loss of control. As with any media publisher, you will be giving power to someone else’s platform. This fits a “single-use” app like Uber (who already has an in-app messenger as well as a Facebook Messenger integrated bot), but if you are trying to increase the quantity and quality of interactions as banks desperately need to be doing, diverting users to another platform may not be the wisest move.

*Fouth,* a bot also amplifies the security problem. How should it identify and verify the user before providing information or allowing for more complex actions such as money transfers? 

*But, the biggest hurdle, as with most digital transformation problems facing banks, will be in core systems integration.*

### Banking ChatBot
Currently the world is moving towards automation. Chatbots are really useful in terms of customer services. Even if chatbots can help by solving 60-70% of banking problems, it would still be very efficient in terms of money and time. So, our vision was to make a chatbot that can help you with the banking related questions. By using a smart bot which can understand the context by analyzing the texts using NLP techniques.

Banks are leveraging AI on the front end to smooth customer identification and authentication, mimic live employees through chatbots and voice assistants, deepen customer relationships, and provide personalized insights and recommendations.

Online digital banks now represent serious competition to the traditional banking sector. With lower fees, faster transactions, digital asset support, and increasingly comprehensive custody solutions, the big banks have no choice but to sit up and take notice.

### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You need to have python and flask installed on your system to run it.

### Installation
Follow the link to get the step by step guide to install the the Rasa Nlu and how to run a the server. 
Also select the training data from  "bankingchatbotabc/AI-engine/data/" directory. "testData(2).json" is the most updated dataset.

### Deployment
To train the model with a dataset

```
python -m rasa_nlu.train -c config_spacy.json
```
To run the server

```
python -m rasa_nlu.server -c config_spacy.json
```

Then run the App.py to deploy the chatbot

### Built using

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The HTTP API was built in python
* [RASA NLU](https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/) - The Natural Language processing was done with it
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - The web framework was used for the chatbot application

### Acknowledgments

* Rasa NLU, the framework helped us a lot.

Our 6 Step Problem Solving Roadmap


Gain the best results in solving complex and important problems. We-Do!

### Step 1: Identify the problem

At this stage, you are defining the scope of the problem you have to solve. Points to consider at this stage include: problem origin (if known), problem impact (e.g. on customers, on staff or reputation) and timeline to solve the problem.

Note: the time factor is important to consider because it influences how much time you can dedicate to thinking through the problem. In extreme conditions, you may run through this entire process in less than an hour.

### Step 2: Structure the problem

Putting the problem into a clear structure for analysis is one of the great insights we bring to our work. What does it mean to structure a problem? It means identifying the important issues.

### Step 3: Develop solutions

According to research by Chip and Dan Heath in their book “Decisive,” most managers develop only two solutions: “Do x or do not do X.” It will come as no surprise that this approach rarely delivers success. Binary choices tend to have a 50% or greater failure rate. On the other hand, fifty solutions is probably too many to handle especially if you are working through a problem solving process on your own.

The Solution Sweet Spot: developing three to five solutions is usually enough.

### Step 4: Select a solution to the problem

With a list of possible solutions on the table, it is now time to decide. 
Note: For large scale problem solving, you may have to follow an organizational template or policy if your solution requires a large amount of money.

### Step 5: Implement a solution

In this step, you put the solution into action. Implementation may become a project of its own. In that case, you have a full toolkit of project management tools and processes to call on.

Tip: If you are solving a novel problem, stay humble about your solution. It may not work or there may be a better way.

### Step 6: Monitor for success

Monitoring the solution and situation is a key step to ensure the problem is truly solved. Failing to follow up – especially if you have assigned the task to someone else – is a recipe for disaster. 

Monitoring is also important because problems are sometimes symptom of a deeper problem.

Tip: Increase the quantity and frequency of reporting when you are working through an important problem.
