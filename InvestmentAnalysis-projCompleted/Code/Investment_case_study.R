## Checkpoint 1 : Data Cleaning and Preparation
...............................................

# Loading the companies and rounds2 files into dataframe companies & rounds2 respectively

companies <- read.delim("companies.txt", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = "\t")

rounds2 <- read.csv("rounds2.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Loading relevent libraries

library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Lowercase the company_permalink of rounds2 df

rounds2$company_permalink <- str_to_lower(rounds2$company_permalink, locale = "e")
head(rounds2)

# Lowercase the permalink of companies df

companies$permalink <- str_to_lower(companies$permalink, locale = "e")
head(companies)

# Storing the distinct unique companies present in rounds2 df in rs_permalinks vector

rs_permalinks <- distinct(rounds2, company_permalink)
head(rs_permalinks)

# Counting the unique companies present in rounds2 df based on permalink column as it is unique for each company
nrow(rs_permalinks)

# Total unique companies present in rounds2 file are 66373


# Counting the unique companies present in companies df based, for every company one row is there in df
length(unique(companies$permalink))

# Total unique companies present in companies file are 66368


# Finding the companies in the rounds2 df which are not present in companies df, storing in companynp
companynp <- rounds2$company_permalink[which(rs_permalinks != companies$permalink)]
companynp

# There is no company in rounds2 file which are not present in companies file

# Merging the two data frames i.e. companies & rounds2 in master_frame df
master_frame <- merge(companies, rounds2, by.x = "permalink", by.y = "company_permalink", all.x = T)
head(master_frame)

# Finding the number of observation present in master_frame
nrow(master_frame)

# Number of observations present in master_frame are 114943

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Checkpoint 2 : Funding type Analysis
.......................................

# Finding if there are NA values present in the column "raised_amount_usd" of master_frame df
sum(is.na(master_frame$raised_amount_usd))

# Assumption :
# There are missing/NA values in raised_amount_usd column of rounds2. However, funded_at is present for those
# We are assuming those values to be 0

# Replacing NA values of raised_amount_usd column of master_frame df with zero(0)
master_frame$raised_amount_usd[is.na(master_frame$raised_amount_usd)] <-0

# Grouping the master_frame based on funding types to calculate the average funding amount for each funding type and storing in funding_grp df
funding_grp <- group_by(master_frame, funding_round_type)%>%
  summarise(mean(raised_amount_usd))
  
# Making the data frame of funding_grp and naming the column names
funding_grp <- data.frame(funding_grp)
names(funding_grp) <- c("funding_type", "average_investment_amount")
funding_grp

# Considering that Spark Funds wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per investment round, finding the which investment type
# is suitable for them

suitable_typ <- filter(funding_grp, between(average_investment_amount, 5000000, 15000000))
suitable_typ

# "Venture" investment type is most suitable type for investment

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Checkpoint 3 : Country Analysis
..................................

# Grouping the master_frame df based on country for venture funding, finding the total funding and storing in countries_vnt df

countries_vnt <- master_frame %>%
filter(funding_round_type == "venture") %>%
  group_by(country_code) %>%
  summarise(sum(raised_amount_usd)) 
head(countries_vnt)

# Making countries_vnt as df

countries_vnt <- data.frame(countries_vnt, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Naming the columns
names(countries_vnt) <- c("country", "funding")

# Ordering countries_vnt df in desc based on funding
countries_vnt <- arrange(countries_vnt,desc(funding))
head(countries_vnt)

# Storing top 9 funding countries in top9 df and identifying the top 3 english speaking funding countries 
top9 <- head(countries_vnt, 9)
top9

# Indentifying the top 3 english speaking countries from dataframe top9 using the pdf provided for countries
# Top 3 countries are USA, GBR & IND

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Checkpoint 4 : Sector Analysis 1
...................................

# Extracting the primary sector of each category from the category_list column of master_frame df and storing in new column primsector

master_frame$primsector <- str_split_fixed(master_frame$category_list,"\\|",2)[,1]
                                           
nrow(master_frame)
head(master_frame)

# Lower case the primsector column of master_frame df
master_frame$primsector <- str_to_lower(master_frame$primsector, locale = "e")

# Loading the mapping file into mapping df

mapping <- read.csv("mapping.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(mapping)

# Changing the wide data format of mapping df to long format and storing in mapping1 df

mapping1 <- gather(mapping, key = "main_sector", value = "c_val", 2:10)
head(mapping1)

mapping1 <- mapping1[!(mapping1$c_val == 0), ]

# Removing c_val column from mapping1 df
mapping1 <- mapping1[-3]
head(mapping1)

# Lower case the category_list column of mapping1 df
mapping1$category_list <- str_to_lower(mapping1$category_list, locale = "e")

# category_list column of mapping1 df has discrepancy, as in many values "na" is replaced with "0". For e.g. "Analytics" is written as "A0lytics".
# So converting "0" with "na" using gsub function

mapping1$category_list <- gsub("0", "na", mapping1$category_list)

# Merging master_frame df & mapping1 based on primary sector & category list respectively, and storing in master_frame df

master_frame <- master_frame <- merge(master_frame, mapping1, by.x = "primsector", by.y = "category_list", all.x = TRUE)
nrow(master_frame)

# Extracting CSV file "master_frame.csv" from R to do the plotting  in Tableau

write.csv(master_frame, file = "master_frame.csv",row.names=FALSE)
