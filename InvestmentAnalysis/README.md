## Fund management embrace machine learning

ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) has already changed some activities, including parts of finance like fraud prevention, but not yet fund management and stock-picking. That seems odd: machine learning, a subset of AI that excels at finding patterns and making predictions using reams of data, looks like an ideal tool for the business. Yet well-established “quant” hedge funds in London or New York are often sniffy about its potential. In San Francisco, however, where machine learning is so much part of the furniture the term features unexplained on roadside billboards, a cluster of upstart hedge funds has sprung up in order to exploit these techniques.

## Business overview

Spark Funds (fund management) wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can make an effective investment decision

The repo contains three parts

- **Data** Schemas and references to sample data used in the accelerator
- **Code** Codes for analysis
- **Docs** Documents defining the problem statement and presentation to Spark Funds' ceo

The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, I'll need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)

## Business domain

Asset Fund Manager

## Problem statement

Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investments
2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

## Objective of the analysis

*	**Investment type analysis:** Understanding investments in the venture, seed/angel, private equity categories, etc. so Spark Funds can decide which type is best suited for its strategy

*	**Country analysis:** Understanding which countries have had the most investments in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well

*	**Sector analysis:** Understanding the distribution for investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight main sectors provided in the mapping file

Our 6 Step Problem Solving Roadmap


Gain the best results in solving complex and important problems. We-Do!

### Step 1: Identify the problem
At this stage, you are defining the scope of the problem you have to solve. Points to consider at this stage include: problem origin (if known), problem impact (e.g. on customers, on staff or reputation) and timeline to solve the problem.

Note: the time factor is important to consider because it influences how much time you can dedicate to thinking through the problem. In extreme conditions, you may run through this entire process in less than an hour.

### Step 2: Structure the problem
Putting the problem into a clear structure for analysis is one of the great insights we bring to our work. What does it mean to structure a problem? It means identifying the important issues.

### Step 3: Develop solutions
According to research by Chip and Dan Heath in their book “Decisive,” most managers develop only two solutions: “Do x or do not do X.” It will come as no surprise that this approach rarely delivers success. Binary choices tend to have a 50% or greater failure rate. On the other hand, fifty solutions is probably too many to handle especially if you are working through a problem solving process on your own.

The Solution Sweet Spot: developing three to five solutions is usually enough.

### Step 4: Select a solution to the problem
With a list of possible solutions on the table, it is now time to decide. 
Note: For large scale problem solving, you may have to follow an organizational template or policy if your solution requires a large amount of money.

### Step 5: Implement a solution
In this step, you put the solution into action. Implementation may become a project of its own. In that case, you have a full toolkit of project management tools and processes to call on.

Tip: If you are solving a novel problem, stay humble about your solution. It may not work or there may be a better way.

### Step 6: Monitor for success
Monitoring the solution and situation is a key step to ensure the problem is truly solved. Failing to follow up – especially if you have assigned the task to someone else – is a recipe for disaster. 

Monitoring is also important because problems are sometimes symptom of a deeper problem.

Tip: Increase the quantity and frequency of reporting when you are working through an important problem.
